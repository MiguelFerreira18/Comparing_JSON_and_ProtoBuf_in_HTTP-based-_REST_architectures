- Notion
- Mendley and Zotero
- Consensus AI / B-on / google scholar / ACM / IEE-Xplore
- Research Rabbit


## Workflow

### 1. Literature Discovery and Selection
- **Consensus AI**: Broad Queries (protocol buffers, REST, serialization format, performance analysis)
- **Trello**: Add potential papers an categorize them to *content for review*
- **Reasarch Rabbit**: Explore further citations and trace influenctial or frequently cited papers

### 2. Literature Manangement and Organization
- **Mendeley/Zotero**: any source after reviews and accepted in trello goes to both mendley and zotero with tags like "performance", "serialization formats", "REST", etc

### 3. Notion: Thesis Dashboard and Literature Review
- **Dashboarding**: Any change in the other places goes to notion immidiatly
- **Literature Review Table**: Add accepted papers here
- **Brain Dump**: Devide notes by sections

### 4. Data Analysis and Literature Comparison

- **Trello**: Revisiting this if there are changes that need to be made
### 6. Drafts to incorporate in the work
- **Notion drafts page**: Create pages for drafts in notion that link literature and data
### 5. Consultation for wording
- **ChatGpt**



## Reasearch Query: 

("Protocol Buffers" OR "ProtoBuf") 
AND ("REST" OR "Representational State Transfer") 
AND ("serialization" OR "data encoding" OR "data interchange format") 
AND ("performance" OR "latency" OR "scalability" OR "resource consumption" OR "efficiency") 
AND ("comparison" OR "benchmarking" OR "evaluation") 
AND ("JSON" OR "XML" OR "gRPC" OR "HTTP-based APIs")
