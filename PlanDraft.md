With a tight 2-week deadline, here’s an accelerated plan that focuses on the essentials:

# Week 1: Problem Refinement, Research Questions, and Methodology Outline

    - Day 1-2: Problem Refinement
        Deliverable: Write a clear problem statement focusing on comparing ProtoBuf and other serialization formats within REST environments.
        Goal: Address the reason for this study (efficiency, scalability concerns) and tie it to modern REST-based architectures.
        Quality Check: Confirm that the problem is tightly scoped around comparing serialization efficiency and aligns with your advisor’s guidance.

    - Day 3: Define Research Questions and Hypothesis
        Deliverable: Write down 2-3 targeted research questions (e.g., “How does ProtoBuf perform in REST APIs versus JSON in terms of latency?”).
        Goal: Questions should guide your experiment design and help answer your problem statement.
        Quality Check: Ensure questions are measurable and directly linked to key attributes (performance, scalability).

    - Day 4-5: Outline the Methodology (Experimental Design and GQM Plan)
        Deliverables:
            Methodology Outline: Describe the proposed experiments and metrics for comparing ProtoBuf and JSON/XML (e.g., response time, resource use).
            GQM Plan Draft: Define the Goal, Questions, and Metrics (e.g., Goal: “Assess ProtoBuf’s efficiency”; Metric: latency under load).
        Quality Check: Confirm each experiment is feasible within the time you have, and that metrics align with your research questions.

    - Day 6-7: Literature Review and Skills Identification
        Deliverables:
            Literature Summary: Collect and summarize 3-5 sources on serialization in REST APIs and ProtoBuf performance.
            Skills Identification: List any additional skills you’ll need for experiments (e.g., familiarity with benchmarking tools).
        Quality Check: Ensure the review addresses gaps your research will fill, and check that you’ve planned for any skill acquisition needed for testing.

# Week 2: Conduct Pilot Testing, Refine Methodology, and Complete Proposal Document

    - Day 8-10: Conduct a Pilot Test and Refine Methodology
        Deliverables:
            Pilot Test Report: Run a small-scale experiment comparing ProtoBuf with JSON (e.g., testing serialization times for a specific API request).
            Methodology Refinement Document: Make any adjustments based on the pilot (e.g., adjust sample sizes, refine metrics).
        Quality Check: Ensure pilot results show that your methodology can yield clear, useful data.

    - Day 11-13: Draft Complete Project Proposal
        Deliverable: A draft project proposal, including the refined problem statement, research questions, methodology, GQM plan, and initial pilot findings.
        Goal: Integrate all components into a single document, following the structure your course outlines.
        Quality Check: Confirm that the proposal is comprehensive, flows logically, and addresses each requirement set by your course.

    - Day 14: Review and Submit
        Deliverable: Finalize the proposal document and submit it.
        Goal: Conduct a last review, ideally with feedback from a peer or advisor, to ensure clarity and completeness.
        Quality Check: Verify that your proposal meets all course and advisor expectations.


This plan will allow you to keep focused, prioritize high-impact tasks, and complete your project proposal within the 2-week window. Let me know if you'd like any specific parts expanded or refined further!
